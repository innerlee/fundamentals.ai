    If there is one important concept in mathematics, then it is symmetry.
    If there are two important objects in mathematics, then they are polynomial and matrix.

    Some terminologies are lingering in my head because I have not understood them.
</p>

<p>
<ul style="text-align:left">
    <li>Atiyah-Singer index theorem</li>
    <li>Riemann-Roch theorem</li>
    <li>Gromov-Witten invariant</li>
    <li>Mirror symmetry</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    When to kill those?
    That is a great question...
