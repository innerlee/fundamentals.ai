    <a href="#">On Music</a>
</h2>
<p>
For music, I've always being an <em>outsider</em>.
Suppose there is an glorious castle of music, then I am a knight on a horse, wandering around the rocky castle, seeking any crackle on the wall, so that I could reach the holy temple.
</p>
</header>
<p>
What is the view inside the castle? How is the temple look like?
Rumors are heard, rules are observed, and masters are recognized.
Still, the essence, I cannot grasp.
Here record my quest to the heart of music.
<p>
